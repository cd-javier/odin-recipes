    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 octopus</li>
      <li>1 kg of potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of sweet paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of hot paprika</li>
      <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preparing the Octopus: Before cooking the octopus, it’s important to
        tenderize it to avoid a rubbery texture. If you have a fresh octopus,
        freeze it for a day or two before cooking, as this helps break down the
        muscle fibers. If you're using a pre-frozen octopus, you can skip this
        step. Thaw the octopus if it was frozen, ensuring it is fully defrosted.
        Fill a large pot with water, adding the bay leaves for extra flavor.
        Bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, grab the octopus by the head
        and dip it into the water three times before leaving it in to cook. This
        "scaring" technique helps curl the tentacles, giving the octopus that
        classic pulpo appearance. Boil the octopus for about 45-50 minutes,
        depending on its size. You’ll know it’s ready when you can easily insert
        a fork into the thickest part of the tentacles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preparing the Potatoes: While the octopus is cooking, it’s time to
        prepare the potatoes. Pulpo a la gallega is traditionally served with
        sliced potatoes, which soak up the olive oil and paprika beautifully.
        Peel the potatoes and slice them into rounds, about 1 cm (0.4 inches)
        thick. Once the octopus has been cooking for about 35 minutes, add the
        potato slices into the same pot and let them cook alongside the octopus
        for the remaining 10-15 minutes. This allows the potatoes to absorb some
        of the octopus-flavored water, adding depth to their taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assembling the Dish: Now that the octopus and potatoes are perfectly
        cooked, it’s time to assemble the dish. Remove the octopus from the pot
        and let it rest for a few minutes. Using kitchen scissors or a sharp
        knife, cut the tentacles into 1 cm thick slices. Arrange the potato
        slices on a serving platter or individual plates, forming a base layer.
        Place the octopus slices on top of the potatoes.
      </li>

        Seasoning the Pulpo a la Gallega: The seasoning is what elevates pulpo a
        la gallega from good to extraordinary. Drizzle the extra virgin olive
        oil generously over the octopus and potatoes. Sprinkle the sweet paprika
        evenly across the dish. If you prefer a bit of heat, you can add some
        hot paprika as well. Finish with a pinch of coarse sea salt, adding a
        burst of flavor to each bite.
      </li>

        Serving and Enjoying: Serve your pulpo a la gallega immediately, while
        it’s still warm. This dish is best enjoyed with a group, accompanied by
        a good Galician white wine like Albariño. As you dig into the tender
        octopus and the perfectly seasoned potatoes, you’ll experience the true
        taste of Spain’s rich culinary heritage. Enjoy your homemade pulpo a la
        gallega!
