    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arguably this is the most ubiquitous tapas in Spain. Doesnâ€™t matter which
      region or tapas bar you are on, they will have it, usually over the
      refrigerated counter on top of the bar. If you have been in Spain you must
      have seen them before. They are this popular not just because they are
      very traditional but because they are delicious and one of our favourite
      tapas to enjoy with some crisps and a cold beer.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1kg fresh anchovies</li>
      <li>300ml white vinegar</li>
      <li>100ml water</li>
      <li>20g salt</li>
      <li>100ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>4 springs of flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class ="steps">
      <li>
        Remove the head and spine of the anchovies with your hands by pulling it
        carefully. Place all your anchovies in a large bowl and wash them under
        cold running water for 5 minutes until the water runs clean. Make sure
        you remove any skins and entrails as you do it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the anchovies in the bowl, feel it with icy water, season with the
        salt and let it rest inside the fridge for about 1 hour, again to help
        extract any blood and dirt from the anchovies as well as season it
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the fridge, rinse them with clean water and pat dry them.
        Place them in a film envelope in a single layer and freeze them for at
        least 24 hours. Remove them from the freezer and let them defrost in the
        fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the vinegar and the water, line the anchovies in a glass or ceramic
        tray and pour the vinegar mixture. Let them pickle in the fridge for
        about 6 to 12 hours, depending on their size.
      </li>
      <li>
        ain it from the vinegar and rinse them in some cold water. They should
        feel terse and white in colour. Mix the parsley with the garlic and the
        olive oil and pour over the anchovies. Let them rest for at least 3
        hours on the marinade before enjoying them. I love serving them with
        some olives, potato crisps and a cold Spanish beer. Salud!
